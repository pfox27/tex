\textbf{\underline{Canadian Computing Competition Announcement}}\\

The results of the Canadian Computing Competition have been released and I wanted to recognize our competitors here at MacLachlan.\\

Our top MachLachlan scores for grade 12 students went to Jayden Won and William Zhang, with our top Machlachlan score in grade 11 going to Andrew Marin. \\

Normally The University of Waterloo selects a group of students who achieve distinction by scoring above a cut-off score that's determined after they analyse all the contest data.  This year, however, they've announced that they won't be doing that because a significant number of students were found to be using Artificial Intelligence during the contest which is against the rules.\\

Our top scores this year are very close to the cut-off for previous years, however, and I know that our MacLachlan competitors competed with integrity so they should be congratulated.\\

Let's have a round of applause this year's computing contest team!
